# Computer Evolution Website - Version 2

This is the second version of my original website project focused on the history and evolution of computers. This version introduces new concepts such as memory hierarchies, the Von Neumann architecture, and modern processors, providing a more in-depth educational resource.

## Features

- **Expanded Content**: Covers the evolution of computers from early devices to modern architectures, including detailed information on each generation of computers.
- **New Concepts**: Introduces memory hierarchies, the Von Neumann architecture, and modern processor development.
- **Educational Focus**: Provides clear and structured content aimed at helping users understand the key concepts in computer organization and architecture.

## Pages

1. **Home Page (index.html)**: Introduction to the website and its contents.
2. **Generations of Computers**: Dedicated pages for each computer generation:
   - **First Generation**: Early vacuum tube computers.
   - **Second Generation**: Introduction of transistors.
   - **Third Generation**: Integrated circuits.
   - **Fourth Generation**: Microprocessors and the rise of personal computers.
   - **Fifth Generation**: Modern processors and AI development.
3. **Von Neumann Architecture**: Explanation of the Von Neumann model, including the CPU, memory, and I/O systems.
4. **Memory Hierarchies**: Overview of memory systems and their roles in computer performance.
5. **Instruments of Computing**: Historical computing devices such as the abacus, Pascal's calculator, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure and layout of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling the website and ensuring responsive design across different devices.
- **Static Images**: Visual representation of computing devices and concepts.

## How to Use
